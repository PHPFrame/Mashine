Plugins API
===

[THIS DOCUMENT IS A WORKING DRAFT]

This document's intended audience is developers looking into writing their own
plugins for Mashine.

NOTE:

*An install/upgrade/uninstall system has yet to be implemented for 3rd party plugins.*

## Anatomy of a plugin

### The AbstractPlugin class

[![Plugins class diagram](http://github.com/E-NOISE/Mashine/raw/master/docs/assets/Mashine-PluginAPI-Class-Diagram.png "Plugins class diagram")](http://github.com/E-NOISE/Mashine/raw/master/docs/assets/Mashine-PluginAPI-Class-Diagram.png)

### The etc/plugins.xml file

### Plugin file structure

## Hooks

Plugins have access to two types of events they can hook in to:

* Mashine hooks (provided by the Hooks object)
* Global Application Events (provided by PHPFrame)

### Mashine Hooks

#### _post_footer_

#### _posts_footer_

#### _dashboard_boxes_

Arguments: none

This hook is triggered in UserController::index() and the output produced by the
callbacks will be printed in the users dashboard. Callbacks registered with this
hook are expected to return an associate array with two keys: _title_ and
_body_. This two strings are used to populate a "dashboard box".

#### _login_form_

Arguments: none

This hook is triggered in UserController::login() and the output produced by the
callbacks will be printed after the login form in the user/login view.

## Shortcodes

See end-user documentation for
[Shortcode API](http://github.com/E-NOISE/Mashine/blob/master/docs/05.Shortcodes.md).

## Options

Options allow plugins to easily store and retrieve data without having worry
about creating their own database tables or writing robust data mapping code.

The `Options` object is available within all classes that descend from
`AbstractPlugin` and it is very useful for storing discrete bits of data like
plugin configuration settings and so on.

The `Options` object implements PHP's `ArrayAccess` interface, which means that
we can use the array syntax to get and set values.

Values set in the `Options` object is automatically persisted in the database
so we don't have to worry about writing our own queries.
