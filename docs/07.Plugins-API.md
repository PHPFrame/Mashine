Plugins API
===

[THIS DOCUMENT IS A WORKING DRAFT]

This document's intended audience is developers looking into writing their own
plugins for Mashine.

* * *

NOTE:

*An install/upgrade/uninstall system has yet to be implemented for 3rd party plugins.*

## Anatomy of a plugin

### The AbstractPlugin class

### The etc/plugins.xml file

## Hooks

Plugins have access to two types of events they can hook in to:

* Mashine events (provided by MashinePlugin::hooks())
* Global Application Events (provided by PHPFrame)

## Shortcodes

See end-user documentation for
[Shortcode API](http://github.com/E-NOISE/Mashine/blob/master/docs/05.Shortcodes.md).

## Options

Options allow plugins to easily store and retrieve data without having worry
about creating their own database tables or writing robust data mapping code.

The `Options` object is available within all classes that descend from
`AbstractPlugin` and it is very useful for storing discrete bits of data like
plugin configuration settings and so on.

The `Options` object implements PHP's `ArrayAccess` interface, which means that
we can use the array syntax to get and set values.

Values set in the `Options` object is automatically persisted in the database
so we don't have to worry about writing our own queries.
