HTTP API
========

The API is REST inspired but has its own peculiarities.

* * *

## Dependencies

* [PECL/OAuth](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.oauth.php) 1.0 or greater (on
  the server end). At the time of writing there is no release available for
  Windows.

* * *

Examples in this document are run using the command line tool `curl`. You will
probably want to invoke the API from another application, for example a PHP
script, or any other kind of application, but starting with `curl` is a very
good idea when getting to know a new HTTP API.

## Calling API methods

The API controllers are all invoked by the ApiController, which acts as a single
end point to enforce all API rules. The main ApiController will delegate to the
appropriate API controller as needed.

The HTTP API is available in a URL formed as shown below:

    {protocol}://{base_url}/api/{method_name}

So for example, if the URL to my Mashine site is http://demos.e-noise.com/mashine/
my API would then be available at http://demos.e-noise.com/mashine/api, and the
"content/get" method could be invoked by requesting the following URL:

    http://demos.e-noise.com/mashine/api/content/get?id=100

Note that in this example we invoke the content/get method and pass it an
argument with the name of 'id' and the value of '100'.


### Passing arguments to an API method

Arguments can be passed either in the query string (GET) or the request body
(POST).

An important thing to know is that the order in which we pass the arguments
doesn't matter when calling the API as they are mapped to the method's
parameters by name, regardless of they order in which they came in.

Example API call passing parameters in query string (GET)

    $ curl -X GET http://demos.e-noise.com/mashine/api/content/get?id=100

    {
        "parent_id":21,
        "slug":"lorem-ipsum-39",
        "title":"Lorem ipsum 39",
        "short_title":"Lorem ipsum 39",
        "pub_date":"2010-08-01 20:23:00",
        "status":1,
        "robots_index":true,
        "robots_follow":true,
        "description":"",
        "keywords":"",
        "body":"<p><strong>Pellentesque habitant morbi tristique<\/strong> ...",
        "type":"PostContent",
        "params":"a:1:{s:4:\"view\";b:0;}",
        "id":100,
        "ctime":1282159401,
        "mtime":1282176485,
        "owner":1,
        "group":2,
        "perms":664
    }

Example API call passing parameters in request body (POST)

    $ curl -X POST -d "parent_id=21&limit=10&page=1&format=xml" http://demos.e-noise.com/mashine/api/content/get

    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <api-response>
        <array>
            <id>99</id>
            <url>http://localhost/mashine/another-post-38</url>
            <title>Another post 38</title>
            <pub_date>2010-08-18 20:23:21</pub_date>
            <type>Post</type>
            <author>Root User</author>
            <excerpt>&lt; p &gt; &lt; strong &gt; Pellentesque habitant ...</excerpt>
        </array>
        <array>
            <id>98</id>
            <url>http://localhost/mashine/lorem-ipsum-38</url>
            <title>Lorem ipsum 38</title>
            <pub_date>2010-08-18 20:23:21</pub_date>
            <type>Post</type>
            <author>Root User</author>
            <excerpt>&lt; p &gt; &lt; strong &gt; Pellentesque habitant ...</excerpt>
        </array>
        ...
    </api-response>

#### Common API arguments

* `format`

  Type: string. Allowed values: "json", "xml", "php". Default is "json".

  The API can format response messages in different ways. By default it will
  format the response body as a JSON string, but we can request the data to be
  formatted as XML or PHP as well.

* `suppress_response_codes`

  Type: bool. Values: 0, 1. Default value is 0.

  This is switched off by default but it is essential to switch on when calling
  the API from Javascript as most browser will block all responses that do not
  have an HTTP status code 200 OK. This deviates from the REST recommendation
  but it is done consciously in order to be practical with real world needs.

* `jsonp_callback`

  Type: string.

  If this argument is included the JSON response will be wrapped in a call to
  this function in order to implement JSONP, as used in
  [jQuery.getJSON()](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/) method.

### Response messages

#### Error messages

All API error responses should include the same data structure in the response
body. Example error message in JSON format:

    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    Date: Sat, 28 Aug 2010 16:12:37 GMT
    Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
    Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0
    Status: 404
    Vary: Accept-Encoding
    Content-Length: 222
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
        "error":
        {
            "request":"http:\/\/localhost\/mashine\/api\/content\/get?id=1000",
            "message":"Content not found.",
            "code":404,
            "timestamp":"Sat Aug 28 17:09:43 +0100 2010"
        }
    }

#### JSON output

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the default response format for the API.
For more info about the JSON format check [http://www.json.org/](http://www.json.org/).

When the `jsonp_callback` argument is included in the request and set to "1"
the JSON response will be wrapped in the callback function allowing the response
data to be passed to the callback function when the API response is received.

#### PHP output

In addition to JSON, the API can format response messages as serialised PHP
data, which can be very useful when invoking the API from a PHP script.

Note that the serialised string will be encoded in base64. So before we attempt
to unserialise the data we should first use `base64_decode()` on the response
body.

The PHP output format is also used when calling the API methods internally from
within the Mashine application. This can be seen in frontend controllers that
delegate data access to the API in order to avoid code duplication and keep
things simple. When doing this the PHP output format can (and should) be used
in combination with the special "return" option available when instantiating
an API controller class or via the PHPFrame_RESTfulController::returnInternalPHP()
method.

For more information about returning PHP data internally check the developer
notes.

#### XML output

This format is still not fully implemented and might not be implemented in the
public release as it is pretty dodgy at the moment and it is not a priority in
the project.
