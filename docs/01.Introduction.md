Mashine Documentation
===

[THIS DOCUMENT IS A WORKING DRAFT]

This is the first attempt to "manually" document the Mashine project and it is
obviously work in progress as Mashine itself is still under development.

## What is Mashine?

Mashine is a simple web publishing platform as well as a great host application
to extend and develop custom apps. Mashine is written in PHP and leverages the
[PHPFrame](http://github.com/PHPFrame) MVC framework in order to provide a
robust and lightweight engine.

## Why use Mashine?

You are probably wondering why should you bother to install Mashine. And you
are probably right, we already have WordPress, Drupal, Indexhibit and so on.
Well, at E-NOISE have been building sites using some of this CMS systems for
years and we felt that it would be a good idea to propose our own vision of
what a CMS could work like.

One of the main reasons why this project started was the fact that none of the
existing main stream PHP CMS systems was written in a test driven manner and
making use of strict Object Oriented design principles. As PHP developers and
consultants we wanted to have unit testing as part of development process in
our projects, and none of the existing apps was up to the job.

On the other hand, looking at how the web is evolving we wanted to have system
that could adapt better to the idea that now we want to build applications that
interact not only with people sitting behind browsers (or screen readers) but
also other applications. Mashine comes with an HTTP API supporting output in
JSON, PHP and XML format. This API also has built-in support for the OAuth
protocol allowing secure interaction with 3rd party applications.

We also found that every time we install a new WordPress or Joomla! site we
always install a number of plugins to make our site a bit more "real world"
ready. Stuff like XML sitemaps, support for Google Analytics, or integration
of Facebook connect. So in Mashine we have picked our favourite plugins and
written the equivalent for Mashine to include it as standard.
