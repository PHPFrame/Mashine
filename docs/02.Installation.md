Installing Mashine
===

[THIS DOCUMENT IS A WORKING DRAFT]

This is a temporary document and will be replaced once a proper installation
procedure has been implemented.

#### Dependencies

* [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) 5 database.

* [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) 2.2.x web server.

* [PHP](http://www.php.net/) 5.2.6 or greater.

* [PEAR](http://pear.php.net/) 1.9.0 or greater.

* [PECL/OAuth](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.oauth.php) 1.0 or greater (on
  the server end) in order to run the OAuth server used by
  [Mashine's HTTP API](http://github.com/E-NOISE/Mashine/blob/master/docs/08.HTTP-API.md).
  At the time of writing there is no release available for Windows. It is tested
  to run smoothly on GNU/Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OSX.

## Why so many different installation flavours?

The Mashine project aims to build a powerful CMS for easy content publishing,
but not just that. It also offers a platform to extend its capabilities and
even add completely new features needed in custom applications.

So Mashine will need to support very different use cases and deployment
environments, because of different needs of different users.

In this document we explain how to install Mashine for:

* End-user (shared, dedicated or cloud). If you just want to install Mashine
  as it is and manage it from its own web interface this installation is right
  for you. Bear in mind that this means that you don't have a local copy of the
  site so you are not expected to need hacking the source code. This is the
  safest option and the recommended one.

* Designers and developers. This one should be used when you want
  to build a site locally, maybe add custom views, write your own plugins and
  so on. More importantly this version includes the build and deploy tools for
  pros.

* Mashine developers. This version is intended for people working on the Mashine
  project itself and it is not covered in this document. See
  [notes for developers](http://github.com/E-NOISE/Mashine/blob/master/docs/11.Notes_for_developers.md)
  for more info.

## Mashine for end-users

### Installing Mashine on a shared hosting account

(Example using E-NOISE shared hosting).

1. Check dependencies

2. Set up database

3. Download package

4. Upload package via FTP

5. Extract package

6. Configuration (etc/phpframe.ini)

7. Web server configuration (.htaccess)

8. Run installation

### Installing Mashine on a dedicated server

(Example using E-NOISE dedicated server).

### Installing Mashine on a cloud service

See [scalability and performance](http://github.com/E-NOISE/Mashine/blob/master/docs/10.Scalability_and_performance.md).

## Mashine for designers and developers

Before we start with the installation lets make sure we gather some information
that we will need during the installation. Stuff like:

* Database info (host, credentials, ...)
* Web server info
* PHP configuration and dependencies

* * *
NOTE:

The installation example is run on a UNIX-like shell and should work fine on
GNU/Linux, BSD and Mac OSX. This installation process has not been tested on
Windows. This document assumes you are familiar with the command line. If you
need to install or configure some of the dependencies you may need to have
root access to the server or workstation.

* * *

### Download and extract package

In this example we download package using `wget`, extract with `tar` and finally
delete the archive as it is no longer needed.

    $ wget http://dist.phpframe.org/apps/Mashine/latest-release/?get=download -O Mashine.tgz
    $ tar -xzvf Mashine.tgz
    $ rm Mashine.tgz

### Prepare file system

Create working directories and make the writable to the web server:

    $ mkdir var tmp
    $ chown :www-data var/ tmp/
    $ chmod 771 var/ tmp/

## Configuration

Create configuration file:

    $ cp etc/phpframe.ini-dist etc/phpframe.ini

Manually edit the configuration file as needed.

## Set up web server

Make public/ directory available via the web server and run in the browser.


## Developer installation

See the [notes for developers](http://github.com/E-NOISE/Mashine/blob/master/docs/11.Notes_for_developers.md).
